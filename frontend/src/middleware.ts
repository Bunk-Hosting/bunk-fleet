/**
 * The Content-Security-Policy, built fresh per request around a one-time nonce.
 *
 * It lives here rather than in next.config.mjs because a nonce cannot be static:
 * a policy shipped from the config would have to allow 'unsafe-inline' to let
 * Next's hydration bootstrap run, and 'unsafe-inline' is the single thing that
 * decides whether an XSS in this app executes or does nothing.
 *
 * `'strict-dynamic'` lets a script the nonce already trusts load more scripts —
 * that is how Next's chunks and the Turnstile widget (which does
 * `document.createElement("script")`) still load. Browsers that only speak CSP2
 * ignore 'strict-dynamic' and fall back to the nonce plus the host allowlist,
 * which is why challenges.cloudflare.com stays listed.
 *
 * - style-src: 'unsafe-inline' is still required — Tailwind and the font loader
 *   both emit inline <style>, and CSS has no equivalent of strict-dynamic.
 * - img-src: data: for TOTP QR codes, blob: for the xterm canvas. No remote
 *   images are ever loaded, so no https: wildcard — that shuts off
 *   tracking-pixel and exfiltration vectors.
 * - connect-src: API + WebSocket + Turnstile + the report endpoint.
 * - worker-src: blob: for the xterm.js web worker.
