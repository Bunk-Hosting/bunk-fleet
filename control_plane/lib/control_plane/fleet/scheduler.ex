defmodule ControlPlane.Fleet.Scheduler do
  @moduledoc """
  Capacity-aware placement of VPS requests onto fleet nodes.

  The scheduler selects an `:online` node in the requested region that has enough
  live available capacity for the request, picks the *least-loaded* fitting node
  (the one with the most headroom remaining after placement), then atomically
  decrements that node's available capacity and records a `:held`
  `ControlPlane.Fleet.Reservation`.

  To avoid overcommitting a node when two placement requests race, candidate rows
  are read with `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` inside a transaction so concurrent
  schedulers serialize on the same node rows.
